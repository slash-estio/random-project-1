## Summary

This comprehensive issue documentation provides a complete roadmap for developing a space game with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Foundation Already Available
- Basic `ControllerInterface` with rotation mechanics
- `PlayerController` with mouse look integration
- Unity Input System with complete action mappings
- Project structure and basic setup

### üéØ Planned Core Features
- **Movement System**: WASD movement with space physics and thrust mechanics
- **Combat System**: Multi-weapon system with projectiles and ammunition
- **AI System**: Intelligent enemies with formations and behavioral patterns
- **Health System**: Shields, armor, damage types, and status effects
- **Progression**: Collectibles, power-ups, upgrades, and scoring
- **Interface**: Complete UI/HUD system with menus and feedback
- **Audio**: Music, sound effects, and 3D positional audio
- **Game Flow**: Save/load, progression, achievements, and state management
- **Visual Polish**: Particle effects, screen effects, and visual feedback

### üõ† Development Approach
Each issue contains:
- **Detailed todo lists** with specific implementation steps
- **Technical requirements** and code architecture guidance
- **Acceptance criteria** for quality assurance
- **Testing checklists** for comprehensive validation
- **Integration guidelines** for system compatibility

### üìã Getting Started
1. Review the [Issues Directory README](./Issues/README.md) for complete development roadmap
2. Start with Issue #1 (Player Controller Enhancement) as it builds on existing code
3. Follow dependency chains to avoid blocking other developers
4. Use the acceptance criteria to validate implementation quality
5. Test thoroughly using the provided testing checklists

This documentation serves as a complete specification for building a professional-quality space game using Unity.
