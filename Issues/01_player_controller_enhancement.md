# Issue #1: Implement Player Controller Enhancement

**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** High  
**Assignee:** Developer Team  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `player-mechanics`, `core-feature`  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  

## Description
Enhance the existing PlayerController to include full space game movement mechanics including thrust, rotation, and space physics. The current implementation only handles rotation towards mouse cursor but lacks actual movement functionality.

## Current State Analysis
**Existing Implementation:**
- ✅ Basic PlayerController class extending ControllerInterface
- ✅ Mouse cursor tracking and rotation system
- ✅ Input System integration with action mappings
- ✅ Rigidbody2D component setup

**Missing Features:**
- ❌ WASD movement implementation
- ❌ Space physics (momentum, drift)  
- ❌ Thrust/propulsion system
- ❌ Boost/sprint mechanics
- ❌ Movement boundaries

## Detailed Todo List

### Core Movement Implementation

  - Read movement input from InputSystem
  - Apply forces to Rigidbody2D for movement
  - Implement proper movement direction calculation
  
- [ ] **Add space physics and momentum**
  - Configure Rigidbody2D settings for space-like movement
  - Implement momentum preservation and gradual deceleration
  - Add drift mechanics that feel authentic to space movement

- [ ] **Create thrust/propulsion system**
  - Implement force-based movement with acceleration
  - Add thrust direction indicators
  - Create thrust sound effect integration points

### Advanced Movement Features  
- [ ] **Implement boost/sprint functionality**
  - Add boost input handling (Left Shift key)

  - Create play area constraint system

### Polish and Enhancement
- [ ] **Add movement sound effects integration**
  - Create audio trigger points for thrust sounds
  - Add boost activation/deactivation sounds
  - Implement engine idle/active sound states

- [ ] **Implement movement visual effects**
  - Add thruster particle effect integration points
  - Create boost trail effects
  - Add movement animation system for ship sprites

- [ ] **Create different movement modes**
  - Normal movement mode
  - Precision movement mode (slower, more precise)
  - Boost mode (faster, less control)

### Input and Controls
- [ ] **Enhance input handling**
  - Add input buffering for responsive controls
  - Implement input smoothing options
  - Add configurable control sensitivity

- [ ] **Improve gamepad support**
  - Test and refine analog stick movement
  - Add gamepad-specific movement curves
  - Implement proper deadzone handling

### Debug and Testing
- [ ] **Add movement debug visualization**
  - Velocity vector visualization
  - Force application visualization  
  - Movement state debug display
  - Input visualization

- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - Optimize force calculations
  - Implement proper FixedUpdate usage
  - Add movement update rate controls

## Technical Requirements

### Code Structure
```csharp
// PlayerController.cs enhancements needed:
- Movement input handling
- Force application system
- Movement state management
- Boost system implementation
```

### Dependencies
- **Input System:** Already configured with WASD bindings
- **Rigidbody2D:** Already attached to player object
- **Physics2D:** Unity's physics system for movement

### Configuration Options
- Movement force strength
- Rotation speed
- Boost multiplier and duration
- Deceleration rate
- Movement boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Player responds to WASD input with movement in correct directions
- [x] Movement feels appropriate for a space game (momentum, drift)
- [x] Boost system activates with Left Shift and provides noticeable speed increase
- [x] Rotation system remains smooth and responsive to mouse input
- [x] Player movement respects game boundaries or screen limits
- [x] All movement feels responsive and fun to control

### Quality Requirements  
- [x] No noticeable input lag or unresponsive controls
- [x] Movement system maintains 60+ FPS performance
- [x] All input methods (keyboard, gamepad) work correctly
- [x] Movement integrates well with existing rotation system
- [x] Code is clean, commented, and follows project standards

### Integration Requirements
- [x] Movement system works with existing ControllerInterface
- [x] Ready for weapon system integration
- [x] Compatible with planned collision detection
- [x] Supports future AI implementation for enemies

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] WASD movement works in all directions
- [ ] Diagonal movement feels natural and balanced
- [ ] Boost system activates and deactivates properly
- [ ] Player cannot move outside defined boundaries
- [ ] Movement works with both keyboard and gamepad
- [ ] Rotation continues to work while moving
- [ ] Performance remains stable during movement
- [ ] No movement-related bugs or glitches

## Notes
- Maintain compatibility with existing ControllerInterface design
- Consider future integration with weapon recoil system
- Keep movement customizable for different ship types
- Ensure movement system can be easily extended for power-ups
