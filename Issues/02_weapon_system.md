# Issue #2: Implement Weapon System

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Assignee:** Developer Team  
**Labels:** `feature`, `combat`, `core-feature`  
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  

## Description
Implement a comprehensive weapon system for the space game including projectile shooting, multiple weapon types, ammunition management, and weapon upgrades. This system will serve as the core combat mechanic for the game.

## Dependencies
- **Issue #1:** Player Controller Enhancement (for firing while moving)
- **Unity Input System:** Attack action already configured
- **Physics2D:** For projectile collision detection

## Detailed Todo List

### Core Weapon Architecture
- [ ] **Create base Weapon class**
  - Abstract weapon class with common functionality
  - Support for different weapon types and behaviors
  - Configurable weapon properties (damage, fire rate, range)
  - Weapon state management (ready, firing, cooling down)

- [ ] **Implement Projectile system**
  - Base Projectile class with movement and collision
  - Projectile pooling system for performance
  - Configurable projectile properties (speed, lifetime, damage)
  - Projectile destruction and recycling

- [ ] **Create weapon firing mechanics**
  - Input handling for weapon firing (mouse click, controller trigger)
  - Fire rate limiting and timing system
  - Projectile spawning and direction calculation
  - Muzzle position and rotation handling

### Weapon Types Implementation
- [ ] **Basic Laser Weapon**
  - High fire rate, low damage projectiles
  - Instant hit or fast projectile speed
  - Energy-based ammunition system
  - Overheating mechanics

- [ ] **Missile/Rocket Launcher**
  - Slower fire rate, high damage
  - Explosive projectiles with area damage
  - Limited ammunition with pickup system
  - Projectile tracking capabilities (optional)

- [ ] **Plasma Cannon**
  - Medium fire rate, medium-high damage
  - Charged shot capability
  - Unique visual and audio effects
  - Penetration through multiple enemies

### Ammunition System
- [ ] **Ammunition management**
  - Different ammo types for different weapons
  - Current ammo tracking and display
  - Maximum ammo capacity limits
  - Ammo consumption per shot

- [ ] **Ammo pickup system**
  - Collectible ammo items in game world
  - Different ammo types (energy, rockets, plasma)
  - Auto-pickup when player contacts ammo
  - Visual and audio feedback for pickup

- [ ] **Ammo regeneration**
  - Energy weapons regenerate over time
  - Cool down periods for overheated weapons
  - Emergency ammo reserves system

### Advanced Weapon Features
- [ ] **Weapon switching system**
  - Multiple weapons equipped simultaneously
  - Input handling for weapon switching (1, 2, 3 keys)
  - Smooth transitions between weapons
  - Weapon selection UI indicators

- [ ] **Weapon upgrade system**
  - Damage upgrades
  - Fire rate improvements
  - Range and accuracy enhancements
  - Special effect upgrades (piercing, explosive)

- [ ] **Weapon cooling/overheat mechanics**
  - Heat generation per shot
  - Cooling over time when not firing
  - Overheat penalties (forced cooling period)
  - Heat level indicators

### Combat Mechanics
- [ ] **Weapon accuracy and spread**
  - Configurable accuracy for each weapon type
  - Bullet spread patterns
  - Accuracy affected by movement and other factors
  - Precision vs spray weapon categories

- [ ] **Weapon recoil system**
  - Screen shake or camera displacement
  - Force applied to player ship (slight pushback)
  - Different recoil patterns per weapon
  - Recoil reduction upgrades

- [ ] **Auto-targeting assistance**
  - Optional aim assistance for casual players
  - Slight projectile steering toward enemies
  - Configurable assistance levels
  - Separate targeting for different weapon types

### Audio and Visual Integration
- [ ] **Weapon sound effects**
  - Unique firing sounds for each weapon type
  - Reload/charging sounds
  - Overheat warning sounds
  - Weapon switching audio feedback

- [ ] **Weapon visual effects**
  - Muzzle flash effects for each weapon
  - Projectile trail effects
  - Weapon glow and energy effects
  - Screen flash effects for powerful weapons

- [ ] **Weapon UI integration**
  - Weapon selection indicators
  - Ammo count displays
  - Overheat/cooling indicators
  - Weapon damage and upgrade displays

## Technical Requirements

### Code Architecture
```csharp
// Core classes needed:
public abstract class Weapon : MonoBehaviour
public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour  
public class WeaponManager : MonoBehaviour
public class AmmoSystem : MonoBehaviour
public enum WeaponType { Laser, Missile, Plasma }
public enum AmmoType { Energy, Rockets, Plasma }
```

### Configuration System
```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class WeaponStats
{
    public float damage;
    public float fireRate;
    public float range;
    public float accuracy;
    public int maxAmmo;
    public float reloadTime;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Object pooling for projectiles to reduce garbage collection
- Efficient collision detection for high-speed projectiles
- LOD system for weapon effects at distance
- Configurable effect quality settings

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [x] Player can fire weapons using mouse click or controller trigger
- [x] At least 3 different weapon types implemented with distinct behaviors
- [x] Ammunition system works with proper consumption and limits
- [x] Weapon switching between multiple weapons is smooth and responsive
- [x] Projectiles move correctly and detect collisions accurately

### User Experience
- [x] Weapon firing feels responsive and satisfying
- [x] Visual and audio effects enhance weapon feedback
- [x] UI clearly shows weapon status, ammo, and selection
- [x] Weapon balance feels appropriate for space combat
- [x] Controls are intuitive and easy to learn

### Technical Requirements
- [x] System maintains 60+ FPS with multiple projectiles on screen
- [x] Memory usage remains stable (no memory leaks from projectiles)
- [x] Weapon system integrates cleanly with player controller
- [x] Code is modular and easily extensible for new weapons
- [x] All weapon behaviors are configurable through inspector

### Integration Requirements
