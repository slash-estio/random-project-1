# Issue #3: Implement Enemy AI System

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Assignee:** Developer Team  
**Labels:** `feature`, `ai`, `enemies`, `core-feature`  
**Estimated Time:** 16-20 hours  

## Description
Create an intelligent enemy AI system with various enemy types, behaviors, and combat patterns suitable for space combat. Enemies should provide engaging challenges while utilizing the existing controller and weapon systems.

## Dependencies
- **Issue #1:** Player Controller Enhancement (AI will extend ControllerInterface)
- **Issue #2:** Weapon System (enemies need weapons)
- **Issue #4:** Health & Damage System (enemies need health)
- **Existing ControllerInterface:** Can be extended for enemy controllers

## Technical Requirements

### Code Architecture
```csharp
// Core AI classes:
public class EnemyController : ControllerInterface
public class AIStateMachine : MonoBehaviour
public class EnemySpawner : MonoBehaviour
public class FormationManager : MonoBehaviour

// AI States:
public enum AIState { Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack, Retreat, Dead }

// Enemy Types:
public enum EnemyType { Scout, Fighter, Bomber, Boss }
```

### AI Configuration
```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class EnemyAIStats
{
    public float detectionRange;
    public float attackRange;
    public float retreatThreshold;
    public float aggressionLevel;
    public float reactionTime;
    public AIState defaultState;
}
```
