# Issue #4: Implement Health & Damage System

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Assignee:** Developer Team  
**Labels:** `feature`, `core-system`, `combat`  
**Estimated Time:** 10-14 hours  

## Description
Implement a robust health and damage system for both player and enemies, including shields, armor, various damage types, and comprehensive feedback systems. This will serve as the foundation for all combat interactions.

## Dependencies
- **None** (this is a foundational system)
- **Future Integration:** Weapon System, Enemy AI System, UI System

## Detailed Todo List

  - Regeneration delays after taking damage
  - Different regeneration types (gradual, instant, over-time)
  - Conditional regeneration (safe zones, items)

### Shield System
- [ ] **Implement shield mechanics**
  - Shield health separate from main health
  - Shield acts as first line of defense
  - Shield break mechanics and effects
  - Shield recharge system with delays

- [ ] **Shield regeneration system**
  - Automatic shield recharge after damage stops
  - Configurable recharge delays and rates
  - Shield recharge interruption by damage
  - Visual and audio feedback for shield states

- [ ] **Shield types and variations**
  - Energy shields (standard regenerating)
  - Temporary shields from power-ups
  - Directional shields (front/back coverage)
  - Shield overcharge mechanics

### Armor and Resistance System
- [ ] **Implement armor mechanics**
  - Physical damage reduction
  - Armor degradation over time
  - Armor repair and upgrade systems
  - Armor effectiveness against different damage types

- [ ] **Damage type system**
  - Energy damage (bypasses some armor)
  - Kinetic damage (reduced by armor)
  - Explosive damage (area effect)
  - Environmental damage (heat, cold, radiation)

- [ ] **Resistance and vulnerability system**
  - Damage type resistances per entity
  - Weakness multipliers for certain damage types
  - Temporary resistance effects
  - Adaptive resistance (changes based on recent damage)

### Damage Feedback Systems
- [ ] **Visual damage feedback**
  - Screen flash effects for player damage
  - Screen shake intensity based on damage
  - Damage overlay effects (red screen tint)
  - Low health warning visual effects

- [ ] **Audio damage feedback**
  - Damage taken sound effects
  - Shield break/recharge audio
  - Low health warning sounds
  - Death/destruction audio effects

- [ ] **Haptic feedback integration**
  - Controller vibration for damage
  - Vibration intensity based on damage amount
  - Different patterns for different damage types
  - Configurable haptic feedback settings

### Health UI Integration
- [ ] **Health bar systems**
  - Player health/shield bars
  - Enemy health bars (optional, configurable)
  - Floating damage numbers
  - Health pickup indicators

- [ ] **Status indicators**
  - Low health warnings
  - Shield status indicators
  - Armor condition display
  - Status effect icons

- [ ] **Damage visualization**
  - Floating damage numbers with different colors
  - Critical hit indicators
  - Damage type visualization
  - Healing amount display

### Status Effects and DOT
- [ ] **Status effect system**
  - Base status effect framework
  - Status effect stacking and duration
  - Status effect removal and immunity
  - Visual indicators for active effects

- [ ] **Damage over time (DOT) effects**
  - Poison/toxic damage
  - Burning/fire damage
  - Radiation damage
  - Energy drain effects

- [ ] **Beneficial effects**
  - Healing over time
  - Temporary damage resistance
  - Health regeneration boosts
  - Shield recharge acceleration

### Advanced Damage Mechanics
- [ ] **Critical hit system**
  - Critical hit chance calculations
  - Critical damage multipliers
  - Critical hit visual and audio effects
  - Critical hit resistance

- [ ] **Overkill and execution mechanics**
  - Extra damage for low-health targets
  - Instant kill thresholds
  - Overkill damage tracking
  - Execution move triggers

- [ ] **Environmental hazards**
  - Damage zones (asteroid fields, energy storms)
  - Collision damage
  - Environmental DOT effects
  - Safe zone healing areas

### Healing and Recovery
- [ ] **Healing item system**
  - Instant heal items
  - Health kits with different potencies
  - Shield repair kits
  - Emergency medical systems

- [ ] **Recovery mechanics**
  - Out-of-combat regeneration
  - Rest areas with enhanced healing
  - Meditation/charging stations
  - Cooperative healing (if multiplayer)

## Technical Requirements

### Code Architecture
```csharp
// Core health system classes:
public class Health : MonoBehaviour
public interface IDamageable
public interface IDamageSource
public class DamageInfo
public class Shield : MonoBehaviour
public class StatusEffect : ScriptableObject
public enum DamageType { Energy, Kinetic, Explosive, Environmental }
```

### Damage Calculation
```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class DamageInfo
{
    public float amount;
    public DamageType type;
    public Vector3 source;
    public GameObject instigator;
    public bool isCritical;
}
```

### Health Events
```csharp
// Events for health system integration:
public UnityEvent<float> OnHealthChanged;
public UnityEvent OnDeath;
public UnityEvent<DamageInfo> OnDamageTaken;
public UnityEvent<float> OnHealed;
public UnityEvent OnShieldBroken;
public UnityEvent OnShieldRestored;
```
