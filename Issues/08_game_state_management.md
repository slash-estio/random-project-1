# Issue #8: Implement Game State Management

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Assignee:** Developer Team  
**Labels:** `feature`, `core-system`, `game-flow`  
**Estimated Time:** 10-14 hours  

## Description
Implement robust game state management including levels, progression, save/load system, and game flow control. This system will manage the overall game experience and provide progression mechanics.

## Dependencies
- **Issue #6:** UI System (menu integration and game flow UI)

public class GameStateManager : MonoBehaviour
public abstract class GameState : ScriptableObject
public class SaveDataManager : MonoBehaviour
public class ProgressionManager : MonoBehaviour

// Game states:
public enum GameStateType { MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver, Loading }

// Save data structure:
[System.Serializable]
public class SaveData
{
    public float totalPlayTime;
    public int highScore;
    public int currentLevel;
    public List<Achievement> unlockedAchievements;
    public PlayerUpgrades upgrades;
}
```

### State Events and Integration
```csharp
// State management events:
public UnityEvent<GameStateType> OnStateChanged;
public UnityEvent OnGameStarted;
public UnityEvent OnGamePaused;
public UnityEvent OnGameEnded;
public UnityEvent OnLevelCompleted;
public UnityEvent<SaveData> OnGameSaved;
public UnityEvent<SaveData> OnGameLoaded;
```
