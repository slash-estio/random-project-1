## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Basic `ControllerInterface` with rotation mechanics
- `PlayerController` extending the interface with mouse look
- Unity Input System integration with comprehensive action mappings
- Basic project structure with appropriate directories

### ❌ Missing Core Features
- Actual player movement (WASD input handling)
- Combat system (weapons, projectiles, damage)
- Enemy AI and spawning
- Health and damage mechanics
- Collectibles and power-ups
- User interface and HUD
- Audio feedback
- Game state management
- Visual effects and polish

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Core Systems Integration
```
PlayerController (ControllerInterface)
    ↓
WeaponSystem → DamageSystem ← EnemyAI (ControllerInterface)
    ↓              ↓              ↓
CollectibleSystem → HealthSystem ← StatusEffects
    ↓              ↓              ↓
UISystem ← GameStateManager → SaveSystem
    ↓              ↓              ↓
AudioSystem ← EffectsSystem → PerformanceManager
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Controller Pattern:** Shared `ControllerInterface` for player and AI
- **Component System:** Modular MonoBehaviour components
- **Event System:** UnityEvents for loose coupling
- **Object Pooling:** For projectiles, particles, and audio
- **State Machine:** For game states and AI behaviors

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Read Issue #1** first as it builds on existing code
2. **Check dependencies** before starting any issue
3. **Follow the todo lists** in each issue for systematic implementation
4. **Test acceptance criteria** before marking issues complete
5. **Update this index** when issues are completed

### For Project Managers
1. **Assign issues** based on developer skills and availability
2. **Track progress** using the status column in the overview table
3. **Monitor dependencies** to avoid blocking other developers
4. **Review acceptance criteria** for quality assurance
5. **Plan releases** around completed phases

## Code Standards and Guidelines

### Unity-Specific Requirements
- Follow Unity naming conventions
- Use SerializeField for inspector-exposed private fields
- Implement proper MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods
- Use Scriptable Objects for data configuration
- Implement proper object pooling for performance

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60+ FPS at all times
- Support 100+ simultaneous projectiles
- Handle 20+ enemies without performance degradation
- Memory usage should remain stable during extended play
- Loading times should be under 3 seconds per level

### Testing Requirements
- Each issue includes a comprehensive testing checklist
- Performance testing with stress scenarios
- Edge case handling and error recovery
- Integration testing between systems
- User experience validation

## Estimated Milestones

### Milestone 1: Playable Prototype (Week 3)
- **Deliverables:** Player movement, basic shooting, simple enemies
- **Issues Completed:** #1, #4, #2 (basic implementation)
- **Goal:** First playable version with core mechanics

### Milestone 2: Core Gameplay (Week 6)
- **Deliverables:** Full combat system, AI enemies, basic UI
- **Issues Completed:** #1-#6 (core features)
- **Goal:** Complete gameplay loop with progression

### Milestone 3: Polished Game (Week 9)
- **Deliverables:** Audio, effects, save system, full polish
- **Issues Completed:** All issues #1-#9
- **Goal:** Release-ready space game
